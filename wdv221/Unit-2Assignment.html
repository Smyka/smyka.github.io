<script>
// #1 this is declaring a variable but not yet setting a value to it
let schoolName;
console.log(schoolName);
// #2 this gives the variable schoolName a value of a stringType
schoolName = "DMACC";
console.log(schoolName);
// #3 this changes the data type of schoolName and its value
schoolName = 42;
console.log(schoolName);
// #4 this makes a new variable and writes it to the page for users to see
let courseName = "WDV221 Intro Javascript";
</script><p>Hello! Welcome to <em><script>document.write(courseName)</script></em>.</p><script>
// #5 this sets testScore to 100 but js ignores the decimal
let testScore = 100.00;
console.log(testScore);
// #6 this sets courseGrade to a float but this time js does display the decimal
let courseGrade = 88.65;
console.log(courseGrade);
// #7 this sets courseCompleted to a boolean value
let courseCompleted = false;
console.log(courseCompleted);
// #8 this sets courseCompleted to a string value of false instead of a boolean. As a result, the console displays it in a different color
courseCompleted = "false";
console.log(courseCompleted);
// #9 this creates a variable that is a string because the value is surrounded by quotes
let stringType = "Hello!";
console.log(stringType);
// #10 this creates a variable that is a number type because an integer is passed as the value
let numberType = 25;
console.log(numberType);
