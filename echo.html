    <p>I've played Echo Arena competitively for over two years. I play in two leagues...<ol><li>VRML: The biggest Echo Arena league where my team has peaked 11th.</li><li>NEPA: A professional league that pays its pro players. There are four levels in this league and I am in the second highest, AAA, which is ranked just below pro.</li></ol</p>

    <p class="clear"><br /></p>

    <p>On 1/31/23 it was announced that Echo VR would be shut down in August. Despite having an active and dedicated community, Meta decided to shut the game down to have the developers work on a new project. This news shocked me and I will truly miss the game when it closes as it has been such a major part of my life.</p><br />
